To Travel is to Live
Oh the places you'll go 
Adventure is worthwhile 
A person susceptible to 
Adventure is worthwhile.
Do not dare not to dare.
Jet lag is for amateurs.
Oh, the places you'll go.
Work, Travel, Save, Repeat 
Wander often, wonder always 
Paris is always a good idea.
Collect moments. Not things.
The journey itself is my home.
Live to travel. Travel to live.
Oh Darling, Let's Be Adventurers.
Adventure is worthwhile in itself 
Not all those who wander are lost.
Little by little, one travels far.
Two roads diverged in a wood and I 
Life is short and the world is wide.
The journey not the arrival matters.
Travel far enough, you meet yourself 
Don't listen to what they say. Go see.
Travel is only glamorous in retrospect
Live your life by a compass not a clock.
You don't have to be rich to travel well 
Wherever you go, go with all your heart! 
The best dreams happen when you're awake.
To live will be an awfully big adventure.
Veni Vidi Amavi We came, We saw, We loved 
Take only memories, leave only footprints.
Don't count the days. Make the days count.
People don't take trips, trips take people 
All you need to know is that it's possible.
Dare to live the life you've always wanted.
People don't take trips, trips take people.
It is better to travel well than to arrive.
Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.
So much of who we are, is where we have been 
Up in the clouds on my way to unknown things 
Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.
He who would travel happily must travel light 
Wherever you go becomes a part of you somehow.
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world.
I haven't been everywhere, but it's on my list.
It feels good to be lost in the right direction
Live life with no excuses, travel with no regret
Travel is never a matter of money but of courage 
It is not down in any map; true places never are 
Jobs fill your pocket, adventures fill your soul 
Live life with no excuses, travel with no regret 
It is not down in any map; true places never are.
My favorite thing is to go where I've never been.
Adventure may hurt you but monotony will kill you.
Once a year, go someplace you've never been before.
Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.
Never let your memories be greater than your dreams.
Jobs fill your pocket, but adventures fill your soul.
Blessed are the curious for they will have adventures 
In the end, we only regret the chances we didn't take.
Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
Blessed are the curious for they shall have adventures.
We wander for distraction but we travel for fulfillment
Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer.
A journey is best measured in friends, rather than miles 
It's not what you look at that matters. It's what you see.
I travel a lot; I hate having my life disrupted by routine.
The world makes way for the man who knows where he is going.
We travel not to escape life, but for life not to escape us.
Wanderlust: a strong desire to wander and explore the world.
Travel is not reward for working, it's education for living.
There are seven days in a week and someday isn't one of them 
Your imagination is your preview of life's coming attractions.
Remember that happiness is a way of travel - not a destination.
Travel doesn't become adventure until you leave yourself behind
The life you have led doesn't need to be the only life you have 
A ship in a harbor is safe, but it not what ships are built for.
Better to see something once than hear about it a thousand times
If you think adventures are dangerous, try routine: It's Lethal.
The life you have led doesn't need to be the only life you have.
The most beautiful in the world is, of course, the world itself.
Better to see something once than hear about it a thousand times 
Never get so busy making a living that you forget to make a life.
A good traveler has no fixed plans, and is not intent on arriving.
There are no foreign lands. It is the traveler only who is foreign
Quit your job, buy a ticket, get a tan, fall in love, never return.
The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.
The gladdest moments, me thinks, is a departure into unknown lands.
One's destination is never a place, but a new way of seeing things.
The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page 
Venice is like eating an entire box of chocolate liqueurs in one go.
Go, fly, roam, travel, voyage, explore, journey, discover, adventure.
I'm in love with cities I've never been to and people I've never met.
The first condition of understanding a foreign country is to smell it 
To travel is to discover that everyone is wrong about other countries.
To say yes to life is at one and the same thing to say yes to oneself.
All journeys have secret destinations of which the traveler is unaware.
Traveling - it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller.
Travel makes one modest, you see what a tiny place you occupy in the world.
Only those who risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.
We travel for romance, we travel for architecture, and we travel to be lost.
We travel, some of us forever, to seek other states, other lives, other souls.
The gladdest moment in human life, me thinks, is a departure into unknown lands 
Traveling's not something you're good at. It's something you do. Like Breathing.
Man cannot discover new oceans unless he has the courage to lose sight of the shore.
A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions.
Why, I'd like nothing better than to achieve some bold adventure, worthy of our trip.
If you are not willing to risk the unusual, you will have to settle for the ordinary.
Do not go where the path may lead; go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.
I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm gonna see the world.
To awaken quite alone in a strange town is one of the pleasantest sensations in the world
Of all the books in the world, the best stories are found between the pages of a passport 
The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes
People do not decide to become extraordinary. They decide to accomplish extraordinary things
To awaken quite alone in a strange town is one of the most pleasant sensations in the world.
The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.
It is good to have an end to journey toward; but it is the journey that matters, in the end.
I travel not to go anywhere, but to go. I travel for travel's sake. The great affair is to move.
Though we travel the world over to find the beautiful, we must carry it with us or we find it not.
Two roads diverged in a wood and I - I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference
If you want to succeed you should strike out on new paths, rather than travel the worn paths of accepted success 
If you reject the food, ignore the customs, fear the religion and avoid the people, you might better stay at home.
Our happiest moments as tourists always seem to come when we stumble upon one thing while in pursuit of something else.
When preparing to travel, lay out all of your clothes and all of your money. Then take half the clothes and twice the money.
Because in the end, you won't remember the time you spent working in an office or mowing your lawn. Climb that damn mountain.
I travel because it makes me realize how much I haven't seen, how much I'm not going to see, and how much I still need to see.
Traveling is a brutality. It forces you to trust strangers and to lose sight of all that familiar comfort of home and friends.
Because in the end, you won't remember the time you spent working in the office or mowing your lawn. Climb that goddamn mountain.
The pleasure we derive from journeys is perhaps dependent more on the mindset with which we travel than on the destination we travel to
Adventure is a path. Real adventure, self-determined, self-motivated, often risky, forces you to have firsthand encounters with the world
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. Explore. Dream. Discover 
We live in a wonderful world that is full of beauty, charm and adventure. There is no end to the adventures we can have if only we seek them with our eyes open.
And then there is the most dangerous risk of all - the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later.
